    <h1>Gulp.js tasks</h1>
<p>I wanted to insert some random text different places in my html document, so used the multi-cursor [alt]+click and typed lorem4 [tab].

    But this just gives me the same sentence "Lorem ipsum dolor sit." allover, anyway I can do this so that it will be random text?

    Doing it manual every place also gives the same line.I wanted to insert some random text different places in my html document, so used the multi-cursor [alt]+click and typed lorem4 [tab].
